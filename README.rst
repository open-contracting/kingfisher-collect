Kingfisher Collect is a tool for downloading OCDS data and storing it on disk and/or sending it to an instance of `Kingfisher Process <https://kingfisher-process.readthedocs.io/>`_ for processing.

.. tip::

   Use the `OCP Data Registry <https://data.open-contracting.org>`__ to access all OCDS datasets worldwide. (The registry uses Kingfisher Collect to prepare datasets on a regular schedule.)

(If you are viewing this on GitHub, open the `full documentation <https://kingfisher-collect.readthedocs.io/>`__ for additional details.)
