class ParaguayAuthMiddleware:
    """
    Downloader middleware that manages API authentication for Paraguay scrapers.

    Both DNCP (procurement authority) and Hacienda (finance ministry) use an authentication protocol based on OAuth 2.

    This middleware helps us to manage the protocol, which consists on acquiring an access token every x minutes
    (usually 15) and sending the token on each request. The acquisition method of the token is delegated to the spider,
    since each publisher has their own credentials and requirements.

    Apparently, a Downloader Middleware is the best place to set HTTP Request Headers (see
    https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/architecture.html), but it's not enough for this case :(.
    Tokens should be generated and assigned just before sending a request, but Scrapy does not provide any way to do
    this, which in turn means that sometimes we accidently send expired tokens. For now, the issue seems to be avoided
    by setting the number of concurrent requests to 1, at cost of download speed.
