"Kingfisher Collect is built on the `Scrapy <https://scrapy.org/>`_ "

"When collecting data from a data source, each of its OCDS files will be "

"By default, these files are written to a ``data`` directory (you can "

"Each spider creates its own directory within the ``data`` directory, and "
"each crawl of a given spider creates its own directory within its "

"started the crawl – in this case, 2020-01-02 03:04:05). The crawl "
